# Q10.Create a function that takes 2 positive integers in form of a string
#  as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):
# "4",  "5" --> "9"
# "34", "5" --> "39"
# Notes:
# If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.

def positive(a,b):
    print(a+b)
a=input("enter")
b=input("enter")
positive(a,b)
